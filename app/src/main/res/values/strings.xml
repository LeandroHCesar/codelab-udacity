    \n\nI love fish.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a loke, and definitely the ocean.
    \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
    \n\nlike eating fish, too.Raw fish. Grilled fish. Poached fish - not so much.
    \n And sometimes I even go fishing.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
    \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
